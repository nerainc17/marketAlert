Pre-market rates for an equity can provide insight how pre-market is doing and how it will be doing when market opens for general investors. These insight will help me prepare to take partial or full exist from held position. 

Functionality this progam delivers is as below:
1. Read tickers from a csv file
2. At defined 3 window, reach out to yahoo finance
3. Fetch pre-market rate for each ticker that is defined in a csv file from yahoo finance
4. Format email notification body in HTML format
5. Trigger email notification to designated email address

SMS delivery to a phone number is also included, but SMS delivery service is not free and content heavy information can not be delivered over SMS efficiently. For SMS delivery, API integration is attempted and it does work.
